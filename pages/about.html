           <h3>Larissa Price</h3>
           <p>&nbspWhat’s Larissa’s Sweet Corner? It’s my space to create, share, and talk about anything I daydream about. I am a third culture kid with a metropolitan mother from Sao Paulo and a father from a tiny town in southern Idaho. My brothers and I were raised speaking portuguese in the home and english everywhere else. We prioritized time with family from both sides and were always invited to party and family reunions in both the US and Brazil.
	<br>&nbspMy father is an engineer and both he and my mother worked their butts off to give us all the opportunities they could dream of, including moving around the US and the abroad. All that time on planes instilled an ever growing hanker to travel and eat food from everywhere! I grew up studying in the US and spending my summers in Brazil with my family. In 6th grade, my dad started working abroad and eventually, we tried following him around. He spent a couple months in Liberia, I did all of high school in Maputo, Mozambique, spent a summer working on an internship in Lobito, Angola, and did a study abroad in Paris, France. In between all of that, I traveled whenever the opportunity presented itself and got whisked off all around western Europe and southern Africa. After moving back to the States for university, I let my heart travel in the foods I explored from international backgrounds.
	<br>&nbspBefore all of that though, I spent counts hours making a mess in the kitchen when my parents weren’t around, and when they were, I volunteered to help. I’d make little heart-shaped peanut butter and sprinkle sandwiches, teddy bear shaped cakes, brigadeiros, and tuna sandwiches for picnics. The older (and taller) I got, the more trust my Vo hesitantly put in me and she allowed me to chop onions and garlic, and stir whatever she was making in one of her pots. Neither mom nor Vo did anything slowly or sloppily. They spoke, walked, and lived life in general at such a fast pace, I still remember jogging beside my mom on fun strolls through a mall or Disneyland. Working in the kitchen was no different. I’ve had knives stripped from my hands countless times when I wasn’t cutting quickly enough, so once I officially learned to chop and dice rapidly, I was accepted in the kitchen and had earned my place!
<br>&nbspSince then, I find myself looking through the fridge to whip something fresh up daily, and now, I get to write about it too!
